                                <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
                                <li>2 eggs</li>
                                <li>blue food dye</li>
                                <li>2 cups plain flour</li>
                                <li>1 cup chocolate chip pieces</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3><em>Instructions</em></h3>
                        <ol>
                                <li>Start by making sure your ingredients are at room temperature.</li>
                                <li>Preheat your oven to 160C.</li>
                                <li>In a mixer, cream together the butter, sugars, and eggs.</li>
                                <li>Add in a splash of blue food dye. If you add it to just the wet ingredients, 
                                    you'll get a nice blue consistency through your cookies.</li>
                                <li>Stir in the flour, then stir in the choc chip pieces.</li>
                                <li>Scoop a tablespoon onto a baking paper-lined tray. 
                                    No need to press them down, they'll flat themselves.</li>
                                <li>Bake for ~15 minutes (depending on your oven).</li>
                                <li>Remove from oven and let cool before eating.</li>
                        </ol>
